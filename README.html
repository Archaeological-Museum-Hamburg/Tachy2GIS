<p><strong>Dependencies:</strong> *Tachy2GIS reqires pyshp to run. If you don’t have it already (test this by typing <code>import shapefile</code> in a python console), you can get it here: [https://github.com/GeospatialPython/pyshp] or via <code>pip</code>.**</p>
<p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> *Tachy2GIS is at this moment restricted to Leica Totalstations and the Leica GSI 8/16 data format. It has been tested with the TPS400- and TS06-series. The functionality with other systems or formats has not been tested.**</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong> *There’s a problem with “Map Refresh” in QGIS 3.0.3. Resulting from this the “Object Count” of a new and empty layer stays at “0” and you can’t zoom in to the measured objects. As a workaround make a copy of the layer and zoom in then.**</p>
<h1 id="tachy2gis-concepts-and-architecture">Tachy2GIS: Concepts and Architecture</h1>
<p>Tachy2GIS (henceforth ‘T2G’) enales you to create geometries directly form tachymeter input while at the same time adding vertices manually. Manually generated vertices snap to features that are already present, in order to avoid overlapping features or holes between directly adjactant geometries. T2G consists of four main elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main dialog window which allows to connect to a tachymeter, preview vertices that are generated and select the source layer</li>
<li>The field dialog that allows editing of the atribute values of new geometries and the selection of the target layer. The concept of source- and targetlayer will be explained later</li>
<li>The vertex picker map tool, that is used to add existing vertices to a new geometry by clicking on or near them</li>
<li>The vertex list that works behind the scenes to make all the above possible. It handles vertex snapping, displaying of current vertices and export of gemetries.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="source--and-targetlayer">Source- and targetlayer</h2>
<p>The sourcelayer is the layer that provides the vertices for snapping, e.g. existing geometries. It is scanned for vertices every time it changes. This process may take some time, ranging from fractions of a second for layers with few simple geometries (a hundred polygons or less) to several minutes for layers with thousands of complex shapes. Scanning invokes a progress dialog and can be aborted if started on a layer that takes too long to load. This will however mean that you will not be able to snap to the geometries in this layer.</p>
<p>The targetlayer is the one that new geometries will be added to. Its geometry type determines the appearance of the map tool -&gt; if the target layer holds polygons, the map tool will draw polies, a point target will show up as simple vertices when adding geometries.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Source- and targetlayer may (and will likely) be identical. They only play different roles in the process. If source and target are identical, all geometries that exist before the one that is being added are available for snapping.</p>
<p>Both layers have to be vector layers and the target layer has to be a shapefile. They do <em>not</em> have to be of the same geometry type though, meaning it is possible to create a polygon target layer that is anchored to reference points in a point source layer.</p>
